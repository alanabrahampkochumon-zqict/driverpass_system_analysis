# DriverPass System Design

This project was completed as part of SNHU’s CS 255: System Analysis and Design course.

## Background

This project was created for DriverPass, a driving training company founded to address the high failure rate among students taking DMV driving tests. Through internal research, DriverPass identified that a significant number of students were failing due to insufficient preparation, particularly with online practice exams and structured on-the-road training.

The goal of this project was to design a web-based system that enables students to book driving lessons, access online tutorials, and complete practice exams. The system proposal was provided by representatives from DriverPass:

**Liam** – Owner of DriverPass

**Ian** – DriverPass IT Officer

## What Was Done and What I Did Well

My primary responsibility was requirements analysis and system design. I translated the client interview into clear functional and nonfunctional requirements, then produced system design artifacts including use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams.

One area I did particularly well was ensuring that the system design remained closely aligned with the client’s business goals, such as role-based access, appointment tracking, and DMV content updates, while keeping the diagrams understandable for both technical and nontechnical stakeholders.

## Revision Plans

If I could revise one part of this work, I would expand the behavioral diagrams, particularly by adding more activity and sequence diagrams for complex user interactions. I would also enhance the presentation materials to better emphasize business value, such as efficiency gains, scalability, and risk reduction, rather than focusing primarily on technical structure.

## Importance of Considering User Needs

A guiding principle in system design is that “you are not the user of the system.” Even when designing or building software, the developer or analyst is rarely the end user. Because of this, it is critical to understand who the users are, what goals they have, and what constraints they face.

Rather than designing for every individual, I relied on user personas, which represent common user behaviors and needs based on real-world data. Exposure to UI/UX principles reinforced how essential user-centered design is to system success. Without strong user adoption and satisfaction, even well-written and technically sound software will fail to deliver real value.

## Takeaways and Future Strategies

One of my biggest takeaways from this course is the importance of planning before implementation. While it may feel faster to begin coding immediately, system analysis and design provide the shared blueprint that keeps teams aligned and prevents costly rework later.

In future projects, I plan to place even greater emphasis on user involvement, early validation, and testing. Techniques such as user observation and usability testing are especially valuable, as people often behave differently than they describe. These methods can uncover critical insights that distinguish a good product from a truly successful one.
